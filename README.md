# Tree Calculator
This is my final project for SE463: Managing Software Development at Butler University. This project is a basic Calculator that takes in an infix expression from the user and converts it to postfix, and then transforms the postfix expression into a tree in order to solve it. The goal of this project was to use common Software Design Patterns, like the Visitor Pattern and the Builder Pattern. 

This project uses abstract classes that I built earlier in this class such as the Array, Base Array, and the Stack. I used my own abstract classes instead of using the clases that are already built in C++.
